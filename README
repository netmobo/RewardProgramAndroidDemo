Description
===============================================================================

This Android application demonstrates how to use the Netmobo platform and 
the FeeFactor API to implement a reward program.


===============================================================================
Introduction
===============================================================================

The Netmobo Reward Program Android Demo application is initially designed to 
use Netmobo's own test configurations. However, it is designed to be 
configurable so that you can use your own data. This page discusses how you 
can configure the application.
 
But first, you must request from Netmobo Support (email to support@netmobo.com) 
so that Rewards feature will be enabled for you.

More information about the Reward Program use case is presented in this page:

===============================================================================
How to Configure the Rewards App to use your Netmobo Account
=============================================================================== 
 
The configuration file is /assets/quickstart.properties.

Replace the values of these variables with the webservice endpoint provided to 
you when you sign up for your Netmobo account. For example, if you were given 
the endpoint "http://api.feefeactor.com/rest", these are the values you would 
need to supply:
  
  #sample values
  feefactor.ws.host = api.feefactor.com
  feefactor.ws.port = 80
  feefactor.ws.path = rest

Supply the BrandID given to you when you sign up for to Netmobo:
  
  feefactor.service.brandid = put your BrandID here

Supply the BrandServiceID given to you by Support Team (mailto: support@netmobo.com) 
when you requested the Rewards service be enabled for you.

  feefactor.service.brandserviceid = put your BrandServiceID here
